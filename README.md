This project implements an AI-powered health platform for brain tumor detection, using synthetic data to simulate a real-world healthcare AI pipeline. It integrates image-based features (e.g., MRI scans) and tabular clinical data (e.g., patient symptoms, vitals) to build a fused machine learning model.

It showcases:

Multimodal data fusion (images + tabular)

CNN-based feature extraction

XGBoost classification

Stratified K-Fold validation

Explainability (SHAP)

Fairness & anomaly detection

This architecture is ideal for research, academic demo projects, and as a scalable base for deploying with real healthcare datasets (e.g., BraTS, TCGA, EHR systems).

AI Model Pipeline
1. CNN for Image Feature Extraction
Functional API model with Conv ‚Üí MaxPooling ‚Üí Dense (penultimate feature layer)

Dropout and L2 regularization to avoid overfitting

2. Tabular Clinical Data
10 simulated clinical features

Class-conditional Gaussian distribution

3. Feature Fusion & Classification
Fuses CNN features + tabular data

Uses XGBoost with early stopping and regularization

4. Evaluation
Stratified 5-Fold CV
